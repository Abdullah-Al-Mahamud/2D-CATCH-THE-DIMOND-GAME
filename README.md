ðŸ’Ž GemRush

GemRush is a fast-paced arcade-style OpenGL game where your goal is to catch falling gems using a basket. The game tests your reflexes and precision as the gems drop faster with every successful catch.

ðŸ“– Overview
This project visualizes how lines are drawn using the Midpoint Line Algorithm, an efficient rasterization method in computer graphics. It also includes zone conversion to handle all octants and a C_T_Dimond class that checks for collisions between diamond-shaped objects.

The program renders points in real time with OpenGL, helping learners understand the fundamentals of low-level drawing and geometric transformations.

âœ¨ Features

. ðŸŽ¯ Midpoint Line Drawing Algorithm implemented in Python

. ðŸ”„ Zone-based transformations for handling all slope cases

. ðŸ’Ž Custom C_T_Dimond class with built-in collision detection

. ðŸŽ¨ OpenGL rendering with point plotting (GL_POINTS)

. âš¡ Step-by-step pixel drawing visualization

ðŸ–¥ Requirements

  . Python 3.x

  . PyOpenGL

  . PyOpenGL_accelerate (optional for better performance)

ðŸŽ® Usage Instructions

ðŸŽ› Controls

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

 . Visualize how the Midpoint Line Algorithm plots pixels on the screen.

 . Understand how zone conversion ensures correct rendering in all slopes.

 . Experiment with simple 2D object collision detection.

ðŸ’€ Program Flow

 . Lines are drawn step by step using the Midpoint Algorithm.

 . Zone detection ensures lines render correctly in all octants.

 . Collision detection checks if two diamond objects overlap.

ðŸ’¡ Tips & Tricks

 . Experiment with different line start/end coordinates to test all slopes.

 . Use collision detection by creating multiple diamond objects.

 . Increase point size in OpenGL to better visualize plotted pixels.
