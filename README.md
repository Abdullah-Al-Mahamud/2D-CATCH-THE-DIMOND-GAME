ðŸ“– Overview
This project visualizes how lines are drawn using the Midpoint Line Algorithm, an efficient rasterization method in computer graphics. It also includes zone conversion to handle all octants and a C_T_Dimond class that checks for collisions between diamond-shaped objects.

The program renders points in real time with OpenGL, helping learners understand the fundamentals of low-level drawing and geometric transformations.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Visualize how the Midpoint Line Algorithm plots pixels on the screen.

Understand how zone conversion ensures correct rendering in all slopes.

Experiment with simple 2D object collision detection.

ðŸ’€ Program Flow

Lines are drawn step by step using the Midpoint Algorithm.

Zone detection ensures lines render correctly in all octants.

Collision detection checks if two diamond objects overlap.
