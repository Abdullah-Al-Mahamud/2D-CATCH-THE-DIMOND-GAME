🚀 Computer Graphics Project – Midpoint Line & Collision Detection

This project is a Python-based graphics assignment built with PyOpenGL + GLUT, showcasing fundamental computer graphics techniques like line drawing algorithms, coordinate transformations, and object collision detection.

✨ Features

Midpoint Line Algorithm → Efficient line rendering with zone conversion.

Custom Object Class (C_T_Dimond) → Represents 2D objects with built-in collision detection.

OpenGL Rendering → Uses glBegin(GL_POINTS) to plot pixels dynamically.

Zone Handling → Converts coordinates between different zones for accurate rendering.

Interactive Visualization → Visualizes core computer graphics principles.
